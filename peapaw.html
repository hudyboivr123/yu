<p>The weather is so beautiful today.  We hope that we will have another day like this one. Many joys have
come our way.  Hudson came to visit and get a music lesson.  Now he is with his oldest grandpa and we are doing some work together 
 and we want to do everything that will bring joy and happiness to anyone.  It is a great time for
us to rejoice and be glad in the Lord.</p>
